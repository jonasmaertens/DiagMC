### DiagMC

Basic diagrammatic monte carlo solver built as a final project for the course "Interactions and Correlations in Condensed Matter" at the University of Bologna. The DMC class can be used to solve tasks 5,6&7 from the PDF, but it could technically be generalized to include arbitrary feynman diagrams. 

The #%% Blocks are Jupyter Cells, intended to be run in an IPython console. VSCode treats them as such.

The Latex directory contains a presentation of the project.
